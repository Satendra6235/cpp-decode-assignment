```The problem we faced in our college:```
 We felt lost without guidance in our first year of college. We didn't know the right path for my
education and career. we missed the chance to connect with experienced students and alumni,
especially in tier 3 colleges where senior support is limited. We all know that getting advice from
experienced seniors can be a game-changer.<br>
<br>
**Solution:**  
```That's why We created "AlumniMentorU".```
The "AlumniMentorU" is an innovative application designed to bridge the gap between alumni and
current students, offering mentorship, guidance, and networking opportunities. It aims to address the
challenges beginners face in their career paths who may need more direction, information, and a
support network.<br>
